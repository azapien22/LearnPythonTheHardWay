# Calculate the square root of pie using python arithmetic:
# To calculate the square root of pi using Python arithmetic, we first need to import the math module which provides 
# several mathematical functions including the square root function. Then we can simply use the math.sqrt() function 
# to calculate the square root of pi as follows:
import math
sqrt_pi = math.sqrt(math.pi)
print(sqrt_pi)
