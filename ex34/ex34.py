# Exercise 34 Accessing Elements of Lists

# A list of strings representing different animals
animals = ['bear', 'python3.6', 'peacock', 'kangaroo', 'whale', 'platypus']

# This line is grabbing the first animal from the list, which is 'bear'. 
# Remember, list indices in Python start at 0, so the first element is at index 0.
animal_at_1 = animals[0]

# This line is grabbing the third animal from the list, which is 'peacock'.
third_animal = animals[2]

# This line is also grabbing the first animal from the list, which is 'bear'.
first_animal = animals[0]

# This line is grabbing the third animal from the list, which is 'peacock'.
animal_at_3 = animals[2]

# This line is grabbing the fifth animal from the list, which is 'whale'.
fifth_animal = animals[4]

# This line is grabbing the second animal from the list, which is 'python3.6'.
animal_at_2 = animals[1]

# This line is grabbing the sixth animal from the list, which is 'platypus'.
sixth_animal = animals[5]

# This line is grabbing the fourth animal from the list, which is 'kangaroo'.
animal_at_4 = animals[3]

# Note that the variable names (e.g., animal_at_1, third_animal) can be a bit misleading because they don't align with
# Python's 0-based indexing. For instance, animal_at_1 is actually referring to the first animal ('bear') which is at
# index 0, not the animal at index 1 ('python3.6'). Similarly, third_animal is referring to the animal at index 2, which
# is the third animal in the list.
