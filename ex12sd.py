# Look online for what pydoc is and what the command does.

"""Pydoc is a documentation generator and online help system that comes with Python. The pydoc command is used to access Python 

documentation in various formats, including HTML, plain text, and man pages. When you run the pydoc command in a terminal, it launches 

a web server and opens a web browser to display the Python documentation. By default, the documentation displayed is for the Python version

 that you are currently using. The pydoc command can be used to display the documentation for modules, classes, functions, and other objects 
 
 in the Python standard library, as well as for any user-defined modules and packages that you have installed.
 
 For example, to display the documentation for the built-in os module, you can run the following command in a terminal: """

pydoc os

pydoc input


"""This will display the documentation for the os module in your web browser. You can also use the -g option to launch a graphical interface 

for browsing the Python documentation, or the -w option to write the documentation to an HTML file."""
