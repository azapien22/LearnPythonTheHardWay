# Exercise 9. Printing, Printing, printing
# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly

# Assigning a string with space-separated days of the week to a variable called days.
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"

# Assigning a string with newline-separated months to a variable called months.
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

# Printing a string literal followed by the value of the variable 'days'.
print("Here are the days:", days)

# Printing a string literal followed by the value of the variable 'months'.
print("Here are the months:", months)

# Printing a multi-line string literal, using triple quotes, which contains text across multiple lines. The string is not assigned to a variable.
print(""" There's something going on here. With the three double-quotes. We'll be able to type as much as we like. Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.""")
